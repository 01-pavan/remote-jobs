## Company blurb

We’re building a platform to accelerate the development of artificial intelligence. Rather than requiring companies to create their own expensive and incomplete homegrown tools, we’ve created a training data platform that acts as a central hub for humans to interface with AI. When humans have better ways to input and manage data, machines have better ways to learn. Learn more about us here: https://labelbox.com/company/about

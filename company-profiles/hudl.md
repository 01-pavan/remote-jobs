## Company blurb

Online video analysis tools that help coaches at any level in every sport win.
Have you ever thought to yourself, “I can’t believe people waste so much time doing [X] in this awesome age of information and technology?”
Alright, maybe you don’t share our excitement for ridiculous superlatives. But that’s exactly what our founders (John, Brian and David) thought in 2006 when they realized exactly how much time and effort was spent by major football teams burning DVD copies of game film and distributing phone-book sized paper playbooks to every single athlete on the team.
Can you imagine?
There was an obvious and straightforward way to help these teams: make all of the video, diagrams, and presentations securely available to the entire team over the Internet.

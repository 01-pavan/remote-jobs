# Blue Bottle Coffee

## Company blurb

[Blue Bottle Coffee](https://bluebottlecoffee.com) is a network of cafes, wholesale partners, and online experiences united by the simple purpose of getting great coffee to everyone who asks for it. We roast coffee on vintage gear, put it in compostable bags, and still get it to our customers within 48 hours. Improbably and delightfully, there are hundreds of us now. We roast on two coasts, make great drinks, clean up after ourselves, bake cookies, type up invoices, get change at the bank, and say please and thank you. We offer the elderly and pregnant our seats on the bus and brush and floss daily. We look forward to seeing you soon.

Youâ€™ll be helping our growing digital team build amazing experiences for lovers of coffee around the world. We craft easytouse tools that allow our guests to shop for coffee and merchandise online, learn about brewing coffee at home, and share their coffee drinking experiences with friends and followers. We also build powerful automated tools that magically help our production teams deliver fresh-roasted coffee to the right person, at the right time.

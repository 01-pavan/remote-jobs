## Company blurb
At 17hats, we wake up each day with one goal in mind â€“ to help small business owners achieve success.

Statistics show that one out of five small businesses fails within the first year. Why? Because most business owners lack the proper business foundation. They burn out before they succeed. It is our job as a company, and as a team, to lower that statistic.

Are you an energetic team player with a passion for small business? If so, we would love you to join 17hats!

## Company size

11-50 employees (as of october 2022)

## Remote status

Every engineer on our team works remotely. That being said, we do need someone who can work California business hours (9am-6pm PST) and who is available for emergencies at night. If you live in the LA area, you are welcome to be in our cool office in Pasadena.

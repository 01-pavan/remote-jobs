# Mapbox

## Company blurb

Mapbox is a mapping platform for developers. Our building blocks make it easy to integrate location into any mobile or online application. We want to change the way people move around cities and understand our planet.
From finding a coffee spot on Foursquare, to pinning a vacation spot on Pinterest, to geo-tagging notes in Evernote – we do the geo stuff so developers can focus on building their app. Mapbox is the foundation for other platforms, letting enterprises analyze their data, drone companies publish flyovers, real estate sites visualize properties, satellite companies process cloud-free imagery, and insurance companies track assets.

Mapbox is an open source company. We build our product with open source parts, work in the open, and release as much code as possible – [it's the right thing for people, technology, and business.](https://www.mapbox.com/about/open/)
